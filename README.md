**Better Barber**

**Description**

> I want to create a better experience when I go to the barbershop. It's frustrating walking into the barbershop not knowing if your barber has 5 or 50 people waiting for them. If you really need the haircut, you will wait, because you don't want to lose your coveted spot. But what if there was a better way.

>This app is designed to locate the nearest barbershop in the system, select a barber, view their profile, view how many people they have waiting and join the queue if you would like. You now will always be in the know of what's going on with your barber and can plan accordingly.

**Technologies:**

* React, React Router
* React Bulma (CSS Components)
* Firebase (authentication)
* Google Maps API

**Future Plans**

> The app in its current state only shows what it can be. I plan on rebuilding this project and adding functionality. This is still a work in progress.

* Firebase (Database)
* Google Places API - to scrape barbershops
* Material Design
